# SIR Simulator | Play with the SIR epidemic model

[SIR Simulator](https://imarijoyborda.com/sir-simulator/) is an interactive application that simulates the epidemic model SIR. It shows the effect of changing any parameter value to the simulation results. Users can play with the model and learn!

Link to project: [https://imarijoyborda.com/sir-simulator/](https://imarijoyborda.com/sir-simulator/).

## How To Use

Visit the site to see use the application. Drag the sliders to adjust the parameter values. See the result of the simulation on the graph.

## How It's Made

This uses the [SIR Model API](https://sir-epimodel-api.herokuapp.com/). Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js. Favicon: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/shapes" title="shapes icons">Freepik - Flaticon</a>

## Future Improvements

There are still lots that need to be improved in this web application. Some plans are:

- Calculate and show the basic reproductive number.
- Compare two or more simulation results side by side.
- Allows toggle between proportion-type model and the numeric-type model.

Contributions are also very welcome! Just issue a pull request.
